            <h3>Comprehensive Analysis of Key Metrics</h3>
            <img src="image.png" alt="Comprehensive Analysis of Key Metrics" class="intext-image">
            <p>With an increasingly data-driven digital economy expanding globally, accurate metrics analysis and 
            visualization are absolutely essential to making informed decisions. This Shiny application is a comprehensive,
            interactive platform that is equipped to analyze and interpret key business metrics for some of the largest tech 
            companies and social media firms like Meta, Google, and Amazon. Availing the strong data science libraries of R, 
            the app offers some tools for analysis such as trend visualization, correlation analysis, comparison of yearly 
            revenue, growth rate calculation, and predictive modeling.Users can browse interactively how quantities like
            internet users, smartphone sales, and other revenue streams evolve over time, identify substantial correlations, 
            and forecast future performance. Strong positive correlations between user activity and revenue growth are found, 
            with dramatic accelerations seen in the late 2020s driven predominantly by the COVID-19 pandemic's acceleration 
            of digital onboarding.It is a decision-making tool of strategy for users like investors, marketers, and analysts. 
            It emphasizes the necessity of user acquisition, retention, and data-backed forecasting to thrive in the dynamic 
            tech landscape. Its future incorporation could include machine learning and demographic analysis to provide even more insights.

            <h3>Sum of Powers Final Project</h3>
            <img src="sum_of_powers.jpg" alt="Sum of Powers Final Project" class="intext-image">
            <p>In this project, we will be generating a generalized function that would allow us to verify the results of Ho, Mellblom, 
            and Frodyma for their theories on the sums of powers of consecutive integers. Once this is achieved and is working as desired,
            we'll then move on to compute the different questions or observations we've seen. Many of these quesitions and observations 
            would consist of potential patterns and conjectures and counterexamples to the sum of powers.</p>

            <h3>An Interactive Story Map on Sámi Culture</h3>
            <img src="Sámi.png" alt="An Interactive Story Map on Sámi Culture" class="intext-image">
            <p>In tracing the journey of the Sámi drums, we uncover not only the socio-cultural and historical contexts surrounding 
            these sacred artifacts but also the resilience and determination of the Sámi people to reclaim their heritage.  From the 
            meticulous collections of Johannes Schefferus to the missionary endeavors of Thomas von Westen, and the exhaustive efforts 
            of Ernst Manker, the drums traveled through time and space, bearing witness to a tumultuous history of cultural suppression 
            and colonial appropriation.  Yet, amidst adversity, there emerged a beacon of hope in Ájtte, a bastion of Sámi heritage and 
            resilience. Through the collective efforts of advocacy and negotiation, the Drum of Resilience and its counterparts found their 
            way back home, symbolizing a reclaiming of identity and cultural autonomy.  Now housed within Ájtte, these drums serve as powerful
            emblems of perseverance and cultural revival. Their rhythms echo through the museum halls, carrying the stories of generations past
            and inspiring future generations to embrace their heritage with pride.  But the journey of the Sámi drums does not end here. As more
            artifacts find their way back to Sámi communities, each carrying with them a piece of history and a testament to the enduring spirit 
            of a people determined to preserve their cultural legacy against all odds, the story continues to unfold.  In the heart of Ájtte and 
            beyond, the journey of the Sámi drums stands as a testament to the resilience of a people and the enduring power of culture to transcend
            boundaries and unite communities in the face of adversity.</p>
