            <h2>Implications of Monetary Policy on Fiscal Policy</h2>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>This research paper investigates the implications of monetary policy on fiscal policy, particularly focusing on the effects of interest rate fluctuations on government spending, borrowing costs, and tax revenue. Utilizing a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model and analyzing data from 1961 to 2023, the study reveals that increases in the federal funds rate lead to higher borrowing costs, which subsequently reduce government spending and contribute to a persistent reliance on deficit budgets. The findings underscore the necessity for policymakers to synchronize monetary and fiscal policies in response to interest rate changes to promote economic stability and growth. Recommendations include diversifying revenue sources and enhancing the efficiency of government spending to mitigate the adverse impacts of rising interest rates.</p>

           </h2>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>This project investigates the sums of powers of consecutive integers, aiming to validate the results of Ho, Mellblom, and Frodyma regarding their theories. A generalized function was developed to verify these identities, 
                focusing on patterns, conjectures, and counterexamples related to the sum of powers.The project validates several identities, including the divisibility of sums involving odd positive integers and the non-divisibility of 
                sums where one integer is even and the other is an odd prime. Further explorations reveal trends in remainders when both integers are manipulated as odd or even, and the implications of these findings are discussed.
                Key questions addressed include the characterization of integer values for divisibility, the effects of changing integer parity, and the identification of specific values leading to consistent remainder patterns.
                The results highlight the complexities of integer sums and their properties, contributing to a deeper understanding of number theory.</p>

            <h2>Echoes of Sápmi</h2>
            <title>Summary of Echoes Across Sápmi</title>
            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            <p>"Echoes Across Sápmi" explores the historical significance and journeys of Sámi drums, sacred objects integral to Sámi culture and spirituality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/79ef3fb66e4b491fa7216ccc13787f6b?play=true&speed=medium">An Interactive Story Map on Sámi Culture</a></strong>: An engaging story map illustrating key themes and insights in my research.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Key Themes:</h2>
            <h3>1. Cultural Significance of Sámi Drums:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drums were vital in Sámi spirituality and community life.</li>
                <li>They served as a connection to ancient traditions and history.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Historical Displacement:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Many Sámi drums were taken during colonial times and are now housed in European museums, often disconnected from their cultural context.</li>
                <li>Notable examples include a drum presented to the British Museum and another confiscated during witch hunts in Norway.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Calls for Repatriation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Thousands of Sámi objects, including sacred drums, are scattered across museums, lacking proper documentation.</li>
                <li>Recent efforts have been made to repatriate these items and foster cooperation between Sámi and European museums.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Resilience and Cultural Revival:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The journey of a seventeenth-century Sámi drum illustrates the resilience of Sámi culture.</li>
                <li>Contemporary Sámi artisans, like Helge Sunna and Gunvor Guttorm, are revitalizing traditional craftsmanship, showcasing the enduring spirit of Sámi identity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5. Historical Context of Drum Dispersal:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Museum Schefferianum in Uppsala was one of the first museums to collect Sámi artifacts, including drums, which were later dispersed to royal collections and museums across Europe.</li>
                < li>The narrative includes the journey of the Freavnantjahke gievrie drum, highlighting its significance and the impact of colonialism on Sámi culture.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>6. Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>The journey of Sámi drums reflects the complex interplay of history, identity, and cultural heritage. The author emphasizes the importance of preserving indigenous cultures and fostering respect and cooperation between communities and museums.</p>
